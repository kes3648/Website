Want to know what Spongebob and Patrick are laughing about? Let me tell you using R and Python!

```{R}
library(reticulate)
```

Python:
```{python}
s="Hey Patrick, I thought of something funnier than 24"
```

R:
```{R}
print(py$s)
z<-"Let me hear it"
```

Python:
```{python}
r.z
y=24
```

R:
```{R}
py$y+1

l<-"lololol"
```

Python:
```{python}
r.l
```
