      <description>IntroductionMain Variable IntroductionThe data set chosen was “pbc”. This data set contains information on a Mayo Clinic Trial for a Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) treatment. The set originally contained 418 observations, with each observation representing a patient involved in the trial. Any observation containing NAs were removed for the sake of simplicity, leaving 276 observations. During this trial, patients were either given the treatment, consiting of D-Penacillamine, or a placebo at random, and then different values and observations were tested and recorded.</description>
