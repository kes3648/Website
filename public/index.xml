      <description>Let’s find the volume of earth!
library(reticulate)## Warning: package &amp;#39;reticulate&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.6.3We know the radius of earth is approximately 6,378 miles long.
#Pythonr=6378We also know that the earth is (roughly) spherical in shape!
#R4*pi*(((py$r)^3)/3)## [1] 1.086781e+12v&amp;lt;-4*pi*(((py$r)^3)/3)We have found that earth’s volume is a really, really big number! It comes out to approximately 1086781000000 cubic miles!
Want to convert that to cubic kilometers?</description>

      <description>IntroductionMain Variable IntroductionThe data set chosen was “pbc”. This data set contains information on a Mayo Clinic Trial for a Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) treatment. The set originally contained 418 observations, with each observation representing a patient involved in the trial. Any observation containing NAs were removed for the sake of simplicity, leaving 276 observations. During this trial, patients were either given the treatment, consiting of D-Penacillamine, or a placebo at random, and then different values and observations were tested and recorded.</description>
