Let's find the volume of earth!

```{R}
library(reticulate)
```

We know the radius of earth is approximately 6,378 miles long.
```{python}
#Python
r=6378
```

We also know that the earth is (roughly) spherical in shape!
```{R}
#R
4*pi*(((py$r)^3)/3)
v<-4*pi*(((py$r)^3)/3)
```

We have found that earth's volume is a really, really big number! It comes out to approximately 1086781000000 cubic miles!

Want to convert that to cubic kilometers? There is 4.168 cubic kilometers for ever cubic mile.

```{python}
#Python
r.v*4.168
```

The eart's volume in cubic kilometers is 4529704427318.763!
